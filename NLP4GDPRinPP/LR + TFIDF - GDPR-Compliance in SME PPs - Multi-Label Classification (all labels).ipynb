    "The goal of this research is to explore--using natural language processing and machine learning techniques--how organisations differ in their approach towards GDPR-compliance. We intend to do this by assessing privacy policies on their *focus* (rather than completeness) of the GDPR user rights and explore whether there is a correlation with the corresponding organisation's meta-data (e.g., country, service, data-driven). This will give us insight in organisations' interpretation of the GDPR (e.g., stressing a specific part) and factors (e.g., company size) that contribute to this particular interpretation.\n",

    "In class imbalance settings, artificially balancing the test/validation set does not make any sense: these sets must remain realistic, i.e. you want to test your classifier performance in the real world setting, where, say, the negative class will include the 99% of the samples, in order to see how well your model will do in predicting the 1% positive class of interest without too many false positives.

In addition to its computational efficiency (only n_classes classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy for multiclass classification and is a fair default choice.\n",
