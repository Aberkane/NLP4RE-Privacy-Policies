Scope

This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) describes how Clarivate (“Clarivate”, “we”, “us” and “our”) collect, use, share, secure, and eventually dispose of (collectively “process”) personal data. Personal data is any information that does, or could, identify you.

This notice applies to personal data collected by our websites, apps, and products (collectively “services”), and in the course of routine offline business contact with you where we are the data controller. Additional information on our personal data practices may be provided in offer descriptions, supplemental privacy notices or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. Certain Clarivate websites may have their own privacy notice – that describes how we handle personal data for those websites specifically. To the extent a notice provided at the time of collection or a website or service specific privacy notice conflict with this Notice, such specific notice or supplemental privacy statement will control.
