Rules for Domain Sellers

The Sedo marketplace was designed to offer both buyers and sellers with a reliable and trusted platform for purchasing and selling domain names. The Rules for Domain Sellers help to ensure the integrity and reliability of the Sedo marketplace and to encourage repeat buyers. Please review the Sales Contract, link below, provided free for domains sold on Sedo.com, which contains your terms of sale.

If you are listing a domain for sale, it is always a good idea to check that your domain is not infringing anyone's trademark rights and that it will not violate our policy regarding offensive domains.

Rules for Domain Buyers

Sedo has created standards for domain sellers and our marketplace would not maintain its reliability and integrity without similar standards for buyers. The Rules for Domain Buyers serve as a set of guidelines to help buyers make the right decisions in their domain name purchases. In addition, these pages help buyers know what to expect when they order a domain acquisition. Please review the sample Sales Contract, link below, provided free for domains bought on Sedo.com, which contains your terms of purchase.

Rules for Domain Parkers

Domain Parking is a great way to market domains you have for sale or to put your domains to work while you develop a website. The Rules for Domain Parkers help you make sure your parked domains do not run afoul of third-party IP rights or Sedo's rules concerning artificial traffic and offensive domains.
