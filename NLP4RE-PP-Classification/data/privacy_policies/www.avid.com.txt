Reduced Policy:   Under GDPR regulation, you have the right to (a) be informed about Avid’s use of your data, (b) to access the data Avid has collected from you, (c) to correct any mistakes in the data Avid has collected, (d) the right to have the data Avid has collected erased, (e) to restrict processing (f) to portability of the information Avid has collected, (g) to object to the collection and processing of information, and (h) to not be profiled. To exercise any of these rights, please contact Avid at privacy@avid.com or via mail at the address below.  NOTICE TO EUROPEAN USERS  Please note that the information you enter on the site or otherwise provide to Avid Technology, or its subsidiaries or divisions, may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, for purposes of processing, by Avid Technology, Inc. a company located in Burlington, Massachusetts, U.S.A., or its subsidiaries or Avid's subsidiaries or divisions, or authorized partners, located worldwide, in order to provide this site and its services to you. You are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. You are further advised that the Council of the European Union has found that this model does not provide "adequate" privacy protections as contemplated by Article 25 of the European Union's Data Directive. (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31)  Article 26 of the European Union's Data Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.  By agreeing to this Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States and the processing of that information as described in this Policy.  RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT (CCPA)  Under the CCPA, California residents have the right to (a) request disclosure of Avid’s practices regarding the collection and/or sale of personal data (including the categories of personal information we collect, the source of that information, our use of that information, and, if personal data has been disclosed or sold to a third party, the categories of personal information we have disclosed or sold and the categories of third parties to whom such information was disclosed or sold), (b) request a copy of individual personal information that we have collected in the twelve (12) month period before your request, (c) request deletion of individual personal information that we have collected (subject to the permitted exceptions for retention of such personal information under the CCPA), (d) request that individual personal data not be sold to third parties, if applicable, and (e) not be discriminated against for exercising any of these aforementioned rights.  California residents have the right to request such information up to two times in any twelve (12) month period.
