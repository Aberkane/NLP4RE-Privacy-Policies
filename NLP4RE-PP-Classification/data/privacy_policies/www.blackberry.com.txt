Reduced Policy:   At BlackBerry we aim to provide the transparency you need to exercise your rights. Below you will find information on your personal data rights as well as how to make requests.  If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and covered by the GDPR, BlackBerry is the Data Controller of your personal data, except where our products and services have been deployed within an organization, such as your workplace or business, where BlackBerry would then act as a Data Processor under the GDPR.  If you are a resident of the State of California, your rights are addressed in this notice under Your California privacy rights and BlackBerry’s practices.  Depending on the jurisdiction where you are located, you may also have rights to contact your local data protection supervisory authority to lodge a complaint against BlackBerry.  Accessing your personal data  Upon written request, BlackBerry will inform you whether it holds personal data about you and provide you with your personal data within a reasonable timeframe and at minimal or no cost in accordance with applicable laws.  If you identify an inaccuracy or incompleteness in your personal data, BlackBerry will amend your information and notify any third-parties as required by applicable laws.  Upon written request, and to the extent authorized under applicable law, BlackBerry will also erase any personal data it holds about you using reasonably appropriate technical measures when:  it is no longer necessary to Process your personal data;you withdraw your consent to Processing unless some other lawful basis exists for BlackBerry to continue to Process your personal data;you object to the Processing and no overriding legitimate grounds exist for BlackBerry to Process your personal data;the personal data has not been lawfully Processed by BlackBerry; oryou have a legal obligation imposed under EU or EU member state law to which BlackBerry is subject.  In certain situations, and depending on applicable laws, BlackBerry may not be able to provide access to the personal data it holds about you if access may adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. For example, BlackBerry may not provide access to personal data if doing so:  would likely reveal personal data about a third-party;would reveal BlackBerry or third-party confidential information;could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual;includes information that is protected by solicitor or attorney client privilege; orincludes information that was Processed in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law.  In order to safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access, BlackBerry may ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your personal data.  Depending on the circumstances and subject to applicable laws, BlackBerry may deny processing your request if:  we are unable to verify and authenticate your identity;it is unreasonably repetitive or automated; orit would be overly broad, ill-defined, or require disproportionate effort which renders the request manifestly excessive.  Withdrawing your consent  At any time, you may withdraw your consent for BlackBerry to Process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Notice, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.  For example, although you can use BlackBerry Solutions for some purposes without providing us with any personal data, BlackBerry may need to Process personal data for some services, including those that require payment or involve an ongoing relationship such as registration or subscription services.  As such, BlackBerry may continue to use your personal data as may be required to provide you with requested services, and to the extent that BlackBerry is contractually obligated to do so or as necessary to enforce any contractual obligations you may have with BlackBerry.  If you refuse to provide BlackBerry with the personal data it requires or later withdraw your consent to use and disclose this information, BlackBerry may no longer be able to provide you with your BlackBerry Solutions.  You may withdraw your consent at any time by notifying the Privacy Office at BlackBerry atprivacyoffice@blackberry.com.
