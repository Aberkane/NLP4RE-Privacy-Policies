Frontiers is the owner of the combination of all content on its websites and of the look and feel of its websites.

Frontiers does not own the copyright in articles you submit to it – you (or your employer or funder) continue to own the copyright in your articles. See the section Licences (permissions) you grant as an authors and the Copyright Statement for more information.

12. Trademarks

"Frontiers In" and "Loop" are registered trademarks of Frontiers Media SA.

Conditions for Submissions of Articles for Peer-Reviewed Publication

13. Submission

If published, your article will in principle remain published permanently, with your personal details and those of your co-authors, as well as those of the reviewers and handling editors, on the Frontiers website, and stored in archives, in repositories and potentially in other places.

When you submit an article to Frontiers, you promise that:

the article is not under consideration by any other journal; if it has been submitted for consideration elsewhere, it has been definitively rejected and is no longer being considered for publication

the article will not be submitted for publication elsewhere unless either published or rejected by Frontiers

you have the explicit consent of all co-authors to submit the article and to accept these conditions, including the granting of the CC-BY licence, on behalf of all co-authors

you have the authorisation of all copyright owners (which may include your employer or funder, and any owners of third-party graphics) to submit the article and to grant the CC-BY licence over the article

an article submitted to report original research is an original contribution, meaning it contains content that has not been previously published in its current form (except for manuscripts deposited as pre-prints in established community-validated pre-print services)

the article does not contain any non-attributed content from any existing source, including the authors’ own existing material

all contributors have been adequately acknowledged

the article and all authors meet the authorship criteria as outlined in the Author Guidelines

the article complies with all the rules on content

all findings have been verified in accordance with the highest scientific standards in the relevant field

all research involving regulated animals (i.e. all live vertebrates and higher invertebrates) has been conducted in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines, all applicable legislation and guidelines and accepted best practices, and the approval body has been identified in the article

research involving human subjects has been conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, you have identified the approval body in the article and the article states clearly that informed written consent was obtained from all participants

the article clearly declares any financial, commercial or other relationships which may be considered to represent a potential conflict of interest

you have disclosed all relevant facts to Frontiers concerning the author(s), the article, the underlying research, any relevant third-party rights and any actual or potential conflicts of interest.

14. Acceptance and Rejection

Acceptance is at Frontiers’ discretion in accordance with its rules and processes. Once accepted, an article will in principle be published; on rare occasions an issue causing rejection may arise or be discovered, in which case the article may be rejected despite having been previously accepted.

15. Publication

There is no prior right to publication. Articles submitted will be subjected to ethical and technical checks and then to our rigorous and interactive peer-review process, which will require your cooperation.

If the article is published, you will become liable to pay our article publication charge (APC), or to ensure that it is paid. Current APCs can be seen here.

The Frontiers peer-review process is designed to ensure scientific rigour and does not check for the satisfaction of the other requirements.

16. Disclosure of inventions

You must ensure that all patent applications have been filed prior to submission of your article.

17. Time for publication

If Frontiers unjustifiably fails to publish an article within a reasonable period of its final acceptance and payment by the author, Frontiers shall refund the publication fee, to the exclusion of any other liability of Frontiers for such failure.

18. The Published Article

Once published, an article can not be removed except by Frontiers’ decision, taken in accordance with accepted retraction processes. The article is likely to be archived and referenced in a number of archives and repositories.

The article will be published with the name(s) and affiliation(s) of the author(s) and the names of the reviewers who endorsed publication during the peer review, as well as that of the handling editor.

Frontiers reserves the right to remove any content, and to retract peer-reviewed articles, which in its view breach any applicable terms of Frontiers and/or which in Frontiers’ view are inappropriate in any way. Such removal does not entitle the author to reimbursement of APC.

Frontiers is not liable for the acts or statements of others.

19. Licences (Permissions) You Grant as an Author

When you submit an article to Frontiers, you grant to Frontiers and to the world at large a permanent, non-cancellable, free-of-charge, worldwide licence (permission) to publish, display, store, copy and re-use that article – including any third-party materials – and to create derivative works from it. You can not terminate that licence. You must ensure that you have all necessary permissions from third parties. Ownership by the third party of the copyright can still be notified on the relevant materials, and attribution must be made in accordance with usual scholarly practices.

The licence (permission) you grant over your article (including any third-party materials included in your article) is a Creative Commons attribution licence (known as a "CC-BY" licence). You can not terminate that licence.

In summary, the CC-BY licence means that anyone may copy, re-publish and/or re-use your content, and create derivative works from it, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, without charge, but must clearly attribute the work to you and any co-authors, and they must cite Frontiers as the original publisher of that content. Complete information can be found here.

You agree that as the Creative Commons organisation updates the CC-BY licence, the licence terms granted by you are automatically updated to the new version.

Reproduction of all or part of an article is also subject to compliance with usual academic attribution practices, which must be scrupulously complied with in addition to the CC-BY requirements.

You may not reproduce or publish any content in any forum (online or not) which advocates any political, religious, anti-religious, racist, extremist, violent or disrespectful viewpoints. If you post any Frontiers content in such a forum, you must remove it immediately on request by Frontiers.

You may also not reproduce any content from our websites in order to denigrate Frontiers.

The same CC-BY licence also applies to any other content, such as reviews, opinions, conference abstracts and blog posts, which you may submit to Frontiers.

You irrevocably grant us permission to use any non-patented ideas set out in your content or in any message sent or submitted to Frontiers, without any charge and without restriction, for any purpose in any part of the world.

Any content of yours appearing on a non-Frontiers website remains subject to the terms and conditions of that website.

20. Disputes

We have mediation processes for settling disputes related to articles, and we mutually promise to exhaust those possibilities prior to commencing any judicial dispute resolution mechanisms.

Advertising, Commercial Promotion and Sponsorships

21. Sponsorship Programmes

Frontiers has sponsorship programmes for Research Topics and other areas. Sponsorships must comply with strict ethical rules. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact us at topics@frontiersin.org.

22. Promotional Messages

Messages and other content promoting a commercial offering are not permitted without Frontiers’ written agreement.

23. Advertising

Frontiers does not currently accept advertisements.

Frontiers is not responsible for content posted by its users, including the content of peer-reviewed articles.

If you believe any content breaches any of these requirements, please contact us at editorial.office@frontiersin.org

26. Text and Data Mining

Frontiers does not object to text and data mining of its website's public content for the legitimate purpose of enrichment of external collections of scientific literature. However, we may need to restrict this activity if it hinders the performance of our website and its services. If you encounter problems, please feel free to contact our technical support: support@frontiersin.org.

27. Availability. Viruses and Attacks. Bugs and Errors

Frontiers endeavours, through active maintenance, to ensure that its websites remain available, bug-free and error-free, but the need for planned and emergency maintenance and the nature of software development mean that no absolute guarantee can be given. We will do what we can to give adequate warning of any planned downtime and to minimise unplanned downtime.

We may from time to time withdraw services and replace them with others.

You are strongly advised to keep back-ups of any content which you do not wish to lose.

Frontiers adopts industry-standard measures to minimise the risk of attacks, viruses, other harmful code and hackers. Given that our platform exists to permit the contribution of content, and given the constant efforts of those with ill intent, we can not guarantee that the website, or links posted by users, will be free from third-party viruses and other malicious third-party software or that we will always be successful in preventing attacks from succeeding. We will continue in our efforts both to prevent such occurrences and to minimise their impact on us and on our users.
