Policy: 
Reduced Policy:   New under GDPR is the right of a user to be ‘forgotten’ by the Livemobility service. Because physical removal is not possible, we will anonymize the profile data of the user instead. For this purpose, a request can be sent to info@livemobility.com stating the account name or number and / or associated e-mail address.  An application will be completed within a maximum of 8 weeks to take into account a period for receiving any fines and closing all invoices. Reports available for legal / tax / cost purposes are no longer available to this user after the application.  Invoices remain in Livemobility Backoffice because there is a legal obligation to keep invoices for tax and legal purposes.  The storage of Livemobility service data for backups is 4 weeks, so the maximum turnaround time to be ‘forgotten’ is 12 weeks in total.  Right of data portability  New to AVG is also the right of a user to have his information exported from the Livemobility services. The user can export his historical booking information via the Livemobility login page and the button.  Data retention  Livemobility B.V. does not store your personal data longer than is strictly necessary by law or for purposes of processing. Livemobility automatically deactivates a user account when it has not been used for 2 years. 2 years after deactivation, the user data of this user account is automatically anonymous.  Changes  Our privacy policy may change from time to time. We will not modify your rights under this Privacy Policy without your express consent. We will post changes to the Privacy Policy in the Livemobility app and we will also keep previous versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
