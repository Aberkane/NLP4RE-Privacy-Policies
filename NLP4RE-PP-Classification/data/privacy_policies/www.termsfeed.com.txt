Reduced Policy:   The rights of users to delete data, make changes, and review data should also be clear in your Privacy Policy.  This is especially true if you transact business in the U.K.  Amazon UK uses a list and plain language. There are also links if users want to unsubscribe from lists or avoid solicitation:    BBC gives each right a separate heading. It's not under some blanket section of "rights" or choices. This includes users accessing their data:    And deleting their data:    There is also a right to reject cookies:    Both approaches here will work well for user rights. Don't forget to provide links to detailed sections and contact information in case users want to access or restrict their data.  Notification of Changes  This is technically a right granted to a user but it often occupies its own heading in a Privacy Policy.If you change your information practices and your Privacy Policy, users must be informed.  Giving yourself the duty to notify users of changes gives you more responsibilities, but this is also in the interest of transparency. Even if only a few users read that announcement on a revised Privacy Policy, you still satisfied your obligation.  These clauses also grant you the right to make changes. This is vital if this is your first Privacy Policy or you released an app that's different from your other products so that you have room to update your Policy as new issues arise and as you tweak and update the app itself and how it functions.  Errors may arise as you distribute your new app and run the next version of your website and you need the tools to address any errors you may have. One of these tools includes updating your agreements.  This portion of your Policy receives its own section and is usually short. LinkedIn offers this provision regarding changes to the Privacy Policy:    Pandora offers a notification section that provides timeframes of when changes go into effect:    You may notice this section includes acceptance language.Do not forget to addthat if users continue with your app or website after the changes, that means that they accepted the new terms.  Contact Information  Good Privacy Policies end with contact information in case users have questions. You can provide this in any format you wish including email addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers or links to online forms.  LinkedIn includes contact information for within and outside the U.S., depending on where a user lives:    Pandora guides users to the "Listener Support" team but also provides a mailing address:    If you handle especially sensitive information like medical history or home addresses, you may want to dedicate a separate email address for these questions. That allows for a timely response and better service to your users.  Your Privacy Policy is a major component of user confidence and legal compliance.  These guidelines will help you write a basic Privacy Policy that's effective and compliant in the main jurisdictions around the world.  If you spend time considering your information practices and gathering details before you draft, this task will be less daunting and your finished Privacy Policy will be accurate, thorough and as complete as possible.
