Policy: The main purpose for which we process your personal data is so that we can provide you with content, products and services, in accordance with the contract you have with us. This includes providing you with account management functionality (such as to update your contact information), processing and collecting payments, customer support (including diagnostics and troubleshooting), call screening and blocking, and tailored and personalised recommendations (including by sending you newsletters about your service, content and relevant products.)

We also process your data to deliver services to you under our contract in the following ways:

In order to enter into loan agreements with you, we obtain personal data about you from credit reference agencies. We then take automated decisions using that personal data about whether or not to enter into the loan agreement with you. This decision is influenced by your credit history and, depending on the outcome of this automated decision-making process, we may not enter into the loan agreement with you. If you would like us to review decisions taken about you as part of this process, please contact us as set out below.

In order to manage our products and services and traffic across our network. For example, Sky uses your information to facilitate the operation of its network by choosing the most efficient route to transmit your requests for a communications service through the various parts of its network of equipment and systems. This information is held securely within restricted areas, accessible only by authorised personnel and in accordance with our data retention, deletion and acceptable use policies;

In order to send newsletters to you about your service, content and relevant products.

If you’re a Sky customer, where you give us consent, we will process your data in order to send you direct marketing. This may include communications by post, telephone, SMS, email or other electronic means (such as push notifications and in-product notifications), using the contact details you have provided, about us and our content products and services, events and special offers, including, for a reasonable time after you have ceased to be a customer of ours (see further details below). We may also rely on your consent to process your data for online and digital advertising (see below at ''How we share your information online for online and digital advertising''), and to process special category data (for example, data you have provided to us or to our business partners concerning your health).

We may also use your information to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. This includes:

by enabling Sky to support customers whose circumstances might make them vulnerable in order to comply with Ofcom’s consumer protection conditions; and

by complying with police and other security investigations.

In some circumstances, we may process your personal data in reliance upon our legitimate interests, including to:

• Improve our content, products, services and customer experiences by monitoring your use of our products and services and working with our suppliers to improve the products and services we offer, and develop new content, products and services;

• monitor, record, store and use customer service communications we have with you. This helps us to improve the quality of our customer service, to confirm any instructions you give us, to create a customer profile to have better conversations and/or for training, development and to meet our legal and regulatory responsibilities.

• Determine what offers for our products and services you are eligible for and how those offers will be made available to you. To do this, we create a profile about your time as a Sky customer (for example, what products and services you have purchased, how you have used them, your offer and payment history, and your interactions with our customer service agents) and supplement this with information provided to us by other organisations as described in this notice. We use these profiles to target our offers at particular groups of customers and personalise the messages.

• In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest to send you direct marketing – for example, if you’re a prospective customer. This may include communications by post, email or other electronic means (such as push notifications and in-product notifications), using the contact details you have provided, about us and our content, products and services, events and special offers, including, for a reasonable time after you have ceased to be a customer of ours (see further details below). This may also involve processing your data for online and digital advertising (see below at ''How we share your information for online and digital advertising'').

• Enable and deliver AdSmart. With AdSmart we show adverts within your TV services to the people most likely to be interested in the products and services being promoted. Sky can show different adverts to different households (in groups of 5,000 or more) watching the same programme or service. To do this we create a profile about a household comprising factors like interests, age and location using the information you have provided to us, information we have acquired from other organisations (as detailed in the section above ‘Types of information we process and where it comes from’), and which we may combine with information received from brands wishing to target their advertising to a particular audience. We use this profile information to define groups of audiences to whom we send adverts. As part of showing these adverts, we also carry out quality and frequency checks, such as whether adverts were displayed correctly and how often particular adverts have been shown. More information about how AdSmart can be used by advertisers can be found here. To the extent any special category data (for example, data concerning health) is processed within AdSmart, Sky relies on your consent for such processing.

• Personalise the promotions and adverts for our products and services that you see while watching Sky, based on what we think you might like and/or what we think might be relevant to you using the household profile we hold for you (as explained above).

• Enable and deliver AdVance. With AdVance, we tailor the digital adverts that you see on Sky or third party websites and apps based on information we know about you or to reinforce or extend the reach of TV adverts you may have seen (or based on content you may have watched). To do this, we process your household viewing data so we know what programmes you like and adverts you may have seen. Subject to your cookie preferences, this is combined with device information and information about websites you have visited to define groups of audiences to whom we deliver digital adverts. More information about how AdVance can be used by advertisers can be found here and in the 'How we use of your information for online and digital advertising' section below.

• For market research.

• Protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party and prevent and detect fraud, including by analysing activity on our network to help block unauthorised or illegitimate content, publication of, or access to it.

We will process your data where we need to in order to safeguard your vital interests or those of another person, for example to support crime prevention and protect the safety of members of the public and Sky employees.
