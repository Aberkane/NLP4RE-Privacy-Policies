Policy: Overstock Privacy Request Process

At Overstock, we are committed to the responsible use of personal information. We comply with applicable federal, state, and international privacy laws and regulations to keep your information safe.

Residents of some states and countries may opt out of the sale or distribution of personal information, request that this information be deleted, or request to have a copy sent to them.

If you are a resident of one of these select states/countries and would like to exercise those rights, you have the following options:

To opt out of the sale or distribution of personal information, please fill out this form.

To receive a copy of any personal information we have, or to request deletion of your personal information, please fill out this form.

We are required to keep all order related information for a minimum of four years for tax and business processing purposes. As such, we cannot facilitate any deletion requests if there is an order on your account within this timeframe. If you are unsure of your last order date, please check your My Account Page before submitting.



Deleting your information will affect your ability to check your order history, provide proof of purchase, and our Customer Care team will not have any record of previous communications with Overstock.com

You will be required to verify your email address and may also be required to provide proof of identity and proof of residency to exercise these rights. Someone legally acting on the behalf of another individual will be required to provide proof of agency. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.

Please add noreply@privacy.overstock.com to your address book to ensure the delivery of privacy request emails to your inbox.

Use the forms linked above for the most efficient way to facilitate a privacy request. If you still have questions or concerns, please contact us at privacy@overstock.com or call us at 1-800-843-2446 for assistance.
