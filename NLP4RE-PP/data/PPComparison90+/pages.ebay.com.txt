Policy: We're actively addressing reports that some sellers are charging unfair or unreasonable prices for certain items on eBay. We encourage our community to report any listings they suspect of unfair pricing to us. See our page on Reporting price gouging on eBay for more information and details on how to start a report.

By becoming familiar with and following our policies, you'll help us maintain a safe environment for all, and be able to avoid interruptions that might come from inadvertent violations of our rules.

Some of our rules reflect local legal requirements, while others are based on our experience of how best to protect everyone using eBay services.

In our policy section, you'll find information on items that can and can't be sold, guides to creating and maintaining listings, details on how we protect your personal details and more.

You can also find our User Agreement, User Privacy Notice, and Cookie Notice. These lay out the most critical information around our terms of use, the information we collect from you, and how we keep that information safe.

Learn about items that can and can't be sold on eBay, and where we have restrictions on the sale of some products and services.

When you bid on or buy and item on eBay, you're agreeing to the rules we've set out for our community.

While feedback is intended as an open forum, we have guidelines and policies to ensure it's used constructively and fairly.

When you buy and sell on eBay, we expect that you and your information are treated in a respectful manner, and that you afford other members the same courtesy.

When you buy on eBay, in most cases, we guarantee that you'll get your item or your money back.

Find out everything you need to know about our rules for creating listings, and get advice on how to make your listings more successful.

Our selling policies are designed to help you deliver the best experience possible to your buyers.

Learn about our motors policy and find out how to sell cars and other motor vehicles on eBay.

Find out how we deal with false reports of policy violations.

Find out how our identity policies protect all of our members, and make eBay a safe and trusted marketplace.

Learn about the approved payment methods sellers can offer in their listings and find help on what to do if something goes wrong.

Learn how to troubleshoot any technical issues you may experience with our site.

Activity that doesn’t follow eBay policy could result in a range of actions including administratively ending or cancelling listings, hiding or demoting all listings from search results, lowering a seller's rating, buying or selling restrictions, loss of buyer or seller protections, account suspension, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement, for example. All fees paid or payable in relation to listings in which we take any action can't be refunded or otherwise credited.
