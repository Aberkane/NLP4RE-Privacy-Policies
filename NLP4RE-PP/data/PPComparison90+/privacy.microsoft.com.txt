Policy: Location information helps us give you directions to the places you want to go and show you info relevant to where you are. For this, we use the locations you provide or that we’ve detected using technologies like GPS or IP addresses.

Detecting location also helps us protect you. For example, if you almost always sign in from Tokyo, and suddenly you’re signing in from London, we can check to make sure it’s really you.

You can turn on or off location services for your device in Settings > Privacy > Location. From here, you can also choose which apps have access to your location and manage the location history stored on your device.
