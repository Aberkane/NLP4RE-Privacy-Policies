Policy: Policies and Core Documents

Evolving out of a comprehensive strategic planning process undertaken in the early 1990s, USC’s role and mission statement outlines the university’s mission and role in Southern California and beyond.

USC is a multicultural scholarly community whose diversity enriches all of our activities and interactions. As such, we aspire to create an environment in which racism, sexism, ageism, xenophobia and homophobia do not go unchallenged. The USC Code of Ethics* is an integral part of our culture, and its underlying principles are tightly woven into the fabric of the USC community.

USC’s policies* have been established to create a safe and productive academic and work environment. All university employees and students are expected to be familiar with these policies and to follow them.

* Any violations of the university’s policies and/or codes of ethics or conduct will be thoroughly investigated upon reporting. Investigations of complaints are centralized and monitored through the Office of Professionalism and Ethics, available at report.usc.edu.

The bylaws of the University of Southern California outline the university’s governance structure and duties of the university’s Board of Trustees.

Since 1994, USC’s growth has been guided by a series of strategic plans. At the time it was developed, each new plan outlined a vision of the university’s future and became a focal point for conversations involving the entire Trojan Family. Today, USC’s previous strategic plans help provide continuity with the past while inspiring future innovation.
