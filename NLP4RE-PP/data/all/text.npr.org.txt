Data analytics

Managing user accounts

Operating, modifying and improving the Services

Identifying usage trends

Customizing content and user experience

Web hosting

Direct marketing

Fraud prevention

Comply with laws and regulations and enforce NPR's Terms of Use and other legal rights.

Consent: We process personal data based on your consent to send personalized messages from NPR and NPR's sponsors (interest based messages or sponsorship), to collect precise location information and to send promotional emails. If you do not consent to the processing, you may still view NPR content on https://text.npr.org but you will not be able to access all of our Services. If you do grant consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time by visiting choice.npr.org, unsubscribing from emails and as described in "Your Rights" below. Please note that all processing of your personal data will cease once you have withdrawn consent but this will not affect any personal data that has already been processed.

Retention

Your personal data is retained no longer than is reasonably necessary to perform the processing described in this Notice and in case of any legal claims or complaints, or as required by law.

Your Rights

Subject to exemptions under applicable law (which may include, depending on the circumstances, U.S. law protecting the rights to free speech and free press or EU law protecting the rights to freedom of expression or information, including processing for journalistic purposes), you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:

To request a copy of your personal data which NPR holds;

To request that NPR provide you access to and/or rectify personal data that is inaccurate or out of date;

To request erasure of your personal data where it is no longer necessary for NPR to retain it;

If you have consented to processing, the right to withdraw consent at any time;

To request that the data controller provide you with your personal data and where possible, to transmit that data directly to another data controller, where applicable. This right of portability only applies where the processing is based on consent or is necessary for the performance of a contract and if NPR processes the data by automated means;

To request a restriction on further processing where applicable;

The right to object to processing if the processing is based on legitimate interest, is for direct marketing, or is for scientific/historical research and statistics;

To lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

You may exercise these rights by contacting NPR at privacy @npr.org, providing the email address you used to register with NPR, and stating your specific request in writing.

Transfer of Data Abroad

Because NPR operates the Services from the US, your personal data may be transferred to the US and/or to countries or territories outside the EEA or Switzerland not recognized by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection pursuant to the GDPR. Where required, data transfers will be made subject to the terms of the applicable EU Standard Contractual Clauses or with your consent. NPR will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice in respect of such transfer.

Security

NPR employs physical, technical and organizational safeguards to ensure an appropriate level of security for personal data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and security for the rights and freedoms of natural persons,

Automated Decision Making and Analysis

NPR and its data analytics and sponsorship vendors analyze user interactions with the Services to deliver personalized content to users and to serve personalized sponsorship messages. This includes tracking user preferences with respect to listening data, websites visited, Member station chosen, and search terms in order to derive a user's interests and preferences. The consequences of such processing for the data subject are that the data subject receives content that may be of interest to him or her, as well as email, online and in-app messages from NPR and NPR's sponsors that are geared towards the interests and preferences of the data subject.

Age Limits

You must be at least 18 years of age to submit any User Materials or Personal Data on or through the Services, create a public profile, or participate in any online contests. If your child is under age 16 and has provided personal data to the Services, please contact us at privacy@npr.org for deletion of the data.

Further Processing

If NPR plans to use personal data for a new purpose, it will update this Notice and communicate the changes to individuals before starting any new processing.
