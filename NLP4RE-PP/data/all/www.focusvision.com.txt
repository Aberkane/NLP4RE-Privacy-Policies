Data Subject Rights and Requests

Instructions for submitting Requests Regarding the Handling of Your Personal Data (For Data Subjects, Data Controllers and website visitors-please read carefully)

There are many laws and regulations protecting and enabling individuals’ privacy rights in effect around the world which give individuals rights regarding their personal data such as the ability to request access, erasure, and restriction of processing. While laws may define personal data differently, this is generally any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. If an organization holds and/or processes your personal data, you may request that the organization take an action on your data as allowed by the relevant law. We refer to this request as a Data Subject Request or DSR .

When making a DSR it is important to understand that most laws require you to make the request directly to the organization that has primary control over your data; referred to as the Data Controller . While FocusVision does process personal data, we are typically acting as a data processor ; collecting and processing your data on behalf of our clients who are the data controller. Further, most laws require that FocusVision (as a data processor) must not take action on personal data requests received directly from data subjects until the data controller has authenticated the request and given FocusVision direction on what action to take. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you contact the data controller directly for the fastest response to your request.

Use of Cookies

FVW uses “cookies” to our services more easily and to help personalize your online experience. A “cookie” is a set of data that a web server stores on your computer that enables the server to recognize your computer. Cookies enable websites to “remember” your entries as you move from page to page, or when you revisit the site from time to time using the same computer. The data set that makes up a cookie will typically not have any meaning to anyone other than the party that placed the cookie. A cookie cannot retrieve other data from your computer’s hard drive or pass on computer viruses. Two different types of cookies are used in connection with our website: “Session cookies” track the user’s progression through our sites in a single visit. These cookies enable us to remember things as the user progresses from one page to another. With most Internet browsers, session cookies are either deleted or rendered inaccessible to us and our agents as soon as the user closes his or her browser. “Persistent cookies” allow us to remember a user at the user’s next visit. Persistent cookies are neither automatically erased nor rendered inaccessible upon closing the user’s browser, although persistent cookies will typically “expire” after some number of years. Upon expiration, such cookies may be deleted by the user’s browser or rendered inaccessible to us. (If you do not want these cookies to remain on your computer, you can erase them through use of your browser settings.) Both session and persistent cookies may also be used in connection with HTML email sent by us. Your browser or other software you install may permit you to restrict the use of session cookies, persistent cookies or all cookies. If you elect to not permit the use of persistent cookies only, you may enjoy the full functionality of our website; however, if you do so, you will need to re-enter some data upon your return visit or during the login process.

Use of Web Beacons

FVW Web pages may contain electronic images known as “pixel tags”, “web beacons” or other technologies (collectively, “web beacons”). Web beacons are used to collect non-personally identifiable data and to assist in delivering cookies on our site and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver services. We may include Web beacons in promotional email messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
