Far more common is a statement that you will not sell or share any customer data. This statement is far more likely to earn the trust of your customers. "We will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose. Period."[8]

If your business model includes selling or distributing customer data, this must be clearly stated in your terms of service. A typical policy includes language that by the customer using your site, they are consenting to the collecting and distribution of their contact information. For example, "By entering this site, we will collect data such as [information] and this data may be shared with our business and advertising partners. Use of this site is your consent to this data collection and distribution."
