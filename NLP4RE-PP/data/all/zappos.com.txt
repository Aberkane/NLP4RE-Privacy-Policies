Policy: At Zappos.com our number one goal is to provide the worldâ€™s best service to our customers. One way we try to do that is by providing the best selection of products we can. While the vast majority of items available on our site are fur-free, we acknowledge that we may carry products made with leather, wool, shearling, down, and, in rare cases, real fur. Whenever this happens we ask that our brand partners use ethically sourced materials for technical (i.e., non-decorative) purposes and that they comply with all applicable laws relating to the sourcing of those materials. There are obviously many sides to this conversation and we respect that some people may not wish to purchase these types of products. With those customers in mind, we also try to provide the best variety of alternatives to these types of products.
