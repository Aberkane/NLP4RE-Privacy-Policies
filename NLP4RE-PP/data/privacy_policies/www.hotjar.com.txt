Usage Data

When you visit our site, we store the name of your internet service provider, the website from which you visited us, the parts of our site you visit, the date and duration of your visit, and information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit. While we process your IP address during the duration of your session, the IP address is truncated and thereby de-identified before it is ever written to disk on our servers. This is done by removing the last octet of your full IP address.

We process this usage data to facilitate your access to our Services (e.g. to adjust our Services to the device you are using), and to recognize and stop any misuse which is in our legitimate interest. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. We also process usage data in an aggregated or de-identified form for statistical purposes and to improve our site.
