## Scraping
In this project, privacy policies are scraped using:
- Google;
- Alexa (https://www.alexa.com/topsites/), and; 
- MOZ (https://moz.com/top500).
as a source for collecting URLs. For each of these URLs we try to extract the privacy privacy of the website. 

## Topic Modeling
In this project, topic modeling is conducted using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The output is a set of topics and for each of them, a number of most-frequent occurring words (or bigrams or trigrams) is given. 

## Dataset
Dataset (see NLP4RE-Privacy-Policies/data) consists of privacy policies and privacy policies' headers, scraped from several sources.
